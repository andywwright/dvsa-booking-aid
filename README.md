# DVSA Booking Aid (Firefox Extension)

A smart Firefox extension that helps you monitor and fast-track DVSA driving test bookings. It refreshes the test center search results and navigates you toward available slots that match your date preferences — giving you a real-time advantage without completing the booking for you.

## Features

- Auto-refreshes test center results every 5–8 minutes
- Detects and clicks available test centers with matching dates
- Countdown timer shown on page
- Popup UI to configure start and end date range
- Sound + tab flashing when a matching slot appears
- Proceeds through date + time selection when available
- Stops automation upon reaching the booking summary
- Pauses if a captcha is detected, alerts the user

> **Note:** This extension does not complete the booking. It helps you get to the slot selection faster, so you can confirm it manually.

## How to Install

1. Open `about:debugging` in Firefox
2. Click "This Firefox" → "Load Temporary Add-on"
3. Select any file inside the extension folder (like `manifest.json`)

> To install permanently, you'll need to submit to the Mozilla Add-ons store.
